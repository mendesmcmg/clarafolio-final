        <Main>
          I'm a web developer located in Brazil. I am currently working at Ribon
          App, a startup focused on enabling donations to NGOs.
          <br /> <br />
          I started to study computer science in 2019 and focused a lot on
          front-end development so far, with React.js being my main framework of
          choice. In spite of that, I also have great interest in back-end
          development, especially with Ruby on Rails.
          <br /> <br />I love to read and watch movies, and right now I'm
          learning more about algorithms, data structures and good practices.
